# image-downloader
this's a small & basic python code i made to make life easier on people who uses toyhouse and want to download all the artwork they have on it ! (‾◡◝)

## before you start :
the code only works on **visible to PUBLIC** characters , therefore if your character is private/locked or visible to logged/authorised users only then the image downloader would be unable to scrape toyhou.se link you provoided for the images and will show an error pop-up.
one way to make this work is by making your character briefly public while the app saves all the images into the desired folder, it doesn't take more than a few seconds to get it all done.
### how to use :
image downloader can be used in two ways, by using the terminal/cmd to launch the .py file and pasting the URL or by using the .exe file which comes with a GUI that asks you for a path/folder to save all the images to.
*the .py file creates a folder named **images** in the directory its located in to save the images*

#### note :
when downloading images they would be saved under the name of their URL ,to preserve the artist/designer credit it should be done manually somehow as im unable to add that feature to the app for now ╯︿╰
